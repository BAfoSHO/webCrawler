# CS3640-A5

This is an open-ended project for Assignment 5 of CS3640. The goal of this project is to crawl and scrape websites to answer a specific question that we are curious about. My question: "What are differences between 1st and 3rd party cookies, and how are they displayed among different types of websites(e-commerce, entertainment, media)?"

## Getting started

This project uses ChromeDriver for Selenium testing. The ChromeDriver is automatically installed when you run the project, but you will need to install Chrome if you don't already have it. You can download Chrome [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
